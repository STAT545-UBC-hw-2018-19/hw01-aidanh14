# Welcome to my Homework repo!

My name is Aidan Hughes and I'm a student at UBC in STAT545A. All the files I make for this assignment live in [this public repo](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-aidanh14/blob/master/hw01_instructions.md).

##Who am I?

As previously mentioned, my name is Aidan. I'm a student at UBC in the Master's of Applied Science *(M.A.Sc)* program for Electrical Engineering. For my thesis, I'm going to be modelling wireless communication links at millimeter-wave frequencies (frequencies above 6GHz). These models are based on :sparkles:***fancy statistics***:sparkles:, so I'm taking a couple stats courses as prep.

I'm originally from [Calgary](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-ab&ei=yP6fW5XOMZa80PEP4vi6OA&q=cowtown+alberta&oq=cowtown+alberta&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i22i30k1l2j38.7232.8479.0.8663.8.8.0.0.0.0.102.688.7j1.8.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.8.683...0i67k1j0i20i263k1.0.Q-uzGBTptOE) but came to Vancouver in 2013 for my undergrad in electrical engineering. In my spare time, I play rugby for a men's club in Kitsilano, ~~enjoy long walks on the beach,~~ go snowboarding in the winter, and watch movies.
