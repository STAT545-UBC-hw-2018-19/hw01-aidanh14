#Who am I?

As previously mentioned, my name is Aidan. I'm a student at UBC in the Master's of Applied Science *(M.A.Sc)* in Electrical Engineering Program. For my thesis, I'm going to be modelling wireless communication links at millimeter-wave frequencies (frequnecies above 6GHz). These models are based on :sparkles:**fancy statistics**:sparkles:, so I'm taking a couple stats courses as prep.
